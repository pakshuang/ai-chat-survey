# Frontend Report

## Introduction

This section serves as an overview of the frontend architecture and design behind our web application. We explain the technical details of our implementation, as well as present the evolution of our interface and experience design based on dogfooding and user interviews, from our initial wireframes all the way to the final high-fidelity application.

## Architecture

- Implementation details
  - Routing
  - Authentication / authorisation
- Technologies used + justification
  - React
  - Chakra UI
- At most one diagram

## Initial design

- Wireframes and high-fidelity application
  - Rubrics: Wireframes to high-fidelity application evolution demonstrated. Justification for choices link back to lecture on design, or from other readings

### Admin portal

- Design of admin portal

### Client interface

- Design of client interface

## Initial user interviews

- Rubrics: where possible, ~5 interviews described briefly; results summarised, indicating how it led to refinements in solution

The following table shows the profiles of the users we interviewed.

| User | Profile                     |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | [age]-year-old [occupation] |
| 2    | [age]-year-old [occupation] |

The following table shows the feedback from each user as well as the refinements made for each piece of feedback.

| User | Feedback                              | Refinement                                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Unclear of importance of chat context | Emphasise importance of the chat context for the admin                        |
| 1    | Quite fun                             | NA                                                                            |
| 1    | Survey ending is abrupt               | Add final message to ask respondent if thereâ€™s anything else they want to add |

## Final design

- Wireframes and high-fidelity application
  - Rubrics: Wireframes to high-fidelity application evolution demonstrated. Justification for choices link back to lecture on design, or from other readings

### Admin portal

- Design of admin portal

### Client interface

- Design of client interface

## Follow-up user interviews

- Rubrics: Repeat consults with user.

The following table shows the feedback from each user after refinements were made.

| User | Feedback |
| ---- | -------- |
| 1    |          |
